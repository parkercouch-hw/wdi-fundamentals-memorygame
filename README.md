# wdi-fundamentals-memorygame

Basic memory card game for wdi pre-work.

TODO:
* ~~Make the match/not a match alert an element on the page instead of a popup~~
* ~~Add a "Reset" button to the HTML and set up an event in the JavaScript file so that the user can reset the game after playing.~~
* ~~Keep track of and display the user's score.~~
* ~~Add a larger board and randomize card placement~~
* ~~Add animations/timeouts for card flips~~
* Update game end alert to look better
* Add difficulty (suit and rank)
* Add board size selector
* Make game board scale to fit

BUGS:
* Game logic fails when a 3rd card is clicked before match is checked.
* Animations can skip sometimes (not consistent)
